        "Billy rode the ferris wheel 7 times. That means he used 35 tickets (5 tickets x 7 rides = 35 tickets). Billy rode the bumper cars 3 times. That means he used 15 tickets (5 tickets x 3 rides = 15 tickets). So in total, Billy used 50 tickets.-->50<|endoftext|>",
        "For the ferris wheel, we know that Oliver rode it 5 times. So, we can say that he used 5 * 7 = 35 tickets for the ferris wheel. For the bumper cars, we know that Oliver rode it 4 times. So, we can say that he used 4 * 7 = 28 tickets for the bumper cars. Now, we just need to add the two answers together to get our final answer. So, 35 + 28 = 63. This means that Oliver used 63 tickets in total.-->63<|endoftext|>",

So, we can just add those numbers together to get the total number of rides, which is 10. Next, we need to find out how much each ride costs. We know that each ride costs 3 tickets. Now, we can multiply the total number of rides by the cost of each ride to find out how many tickets Oliver used in total. So, 10 rides x 3 tickets/ride = 30 tickets-->30<|endoftext|>",
